    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - importing Test::Roo makes the current class a subclass of
      Test::Roo::Class; all methods moved there instead of being exported

    - done_testing is never called automatically

      tests; can be called as object or class method

    - Test::Roo::Class has lazy 'description' attribute for generating
      descriptions from test attributes

    - Added 'each_test' hook for global actions before/after every test

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Includes Test::Roo::Cookbook with examples

    - Test::Roo docs explain differences from Test::Routine
